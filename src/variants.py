"""The Spark-X2.6 quantizations an admin can choose, each with an estimate of what it takes and where this machine can run it.

The quantizations are the GGUF files of `XHToken/Spark-X2.6-1.7B-GGUF` that Ollama can pull as `hf.co/<repo>:<quant>`; the
sizes are the real file sizes from the Hub (each tag was checked against the registry manifest). The repository also holds
an unquantized file, which Ollama cannot pull by a tag, so it is not offered.

The estimate is arithmetic, not a measurement: the file size times 1.1 plus 400 MB for the context and the runtime.
Ollama decides where a model runs; the card says "GPU" when the estimate fits the free GPU memory, "CPU" when it only
fits in free RAM (slower), and nothing is claimed when this service cannot see Ollama's machine.

shortcut: free memory is read when the page is opened and does not know what Ollama will load next."""
